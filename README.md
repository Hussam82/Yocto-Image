# Yocto-Image
This repository contains code and instructions for building a custom Linux distribution using Yocto Project. The resulting image can be used on embedded devices such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, and others.

## Features
Customizable Linux distribution
Support for various hardware platforms
Cross-compilation support
Automatic dependency resolution
Custom kernel and bootloader configuration
## Installation
Clone the repository
Install dependencies (see the Yocto Project documentation for details)
Configure the build environment (source the oe-init-build-env script)
Build the image (bitbake <image-name>)
## Usage
Flash the resulting image to the target device
Boot the device and log in using the credentials specified in the image configuration
## Limitations
Requires some familiarity with the Yocto Project and Linux system administration
Builds can take a long time on slower hardware
Device compatibility may vary depending on the selected options and configurations
## Acknowledgments
This project was inspired and influenced by the work of the Yocto Project community and developers.
Also, it was mentored by Eng. Moatassem ElSayed a Senior Embedded Linux Engineer at Valeo
